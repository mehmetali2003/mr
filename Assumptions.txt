Under this(.\MarsRover\MarsRover\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1) path,
there are Input.txt and Output.txt files. I wrote the input you gave to this file. When you run application you can see result in Output.txt file.

Assumptions:
1. If a rover reaches to one coordinate of upper-right coordinates,
it can't move and has to be remain in its current position. 

2. If there is a rover in position to which it reaches in next step, it can't move and has to remain in its current position.
